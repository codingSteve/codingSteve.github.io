Just the stuff you need.
------------------------

Everything important I have learned in over fifteen years is here. 
Described by people who are more effective than I am. 
This is all you need to run rings around your peers and 
become utterly indispensable in every team you work on and 
it will not take you a whole career to read.

[Tim][FHB] says to set your [priority][FPH] [for the day][MTM]:

> - Wake up at least 1 hour before you have to be at a computer screen
> - Sit down with a pen/pencil and paper
> - Write down the 3-5 things that are making you most anxious or uncomfortable.
> - For each item, ask yourself:
>    * “If this were the only thing I accomplished today, would I be satisfied with my day?”
>    * “Will moving this forward make all the other to-dos unimportant or easier to knock off later?”
> - Look only at the items you answered “yes” to for at least one of these questions.
> - Block out at 2-3 hours to focus on one of them for today:
>    - Cobbling together 10 minutes here and there to add up to 120 minutes does not work
>    - *TO BE CLEAR*: Block out at 2-3 HOURS to focus on ONE of them for today
>    - **This is ONE BLOCK OF TIME** and you need to defend it 
>     
> - If you get distracted, just gently come back to your ONE to-do.
> 
> Congratulations! That’s it.


When [developing][DTB]:

> - Respect people and their time
> - Respect your craft
> - Be sincere
> - Create genuinely useful things

- Be happy because you are coding 
- Prefer logging over debugging
- Prefer refactoring over comments
- You can always [automate][XWI] boring things
- Keep it simple
- Use the keyboard shortcuts
- Code wins arguments 

When [leading][TCL] a team:

> - Assign fun tasks to someone else
> - Do the unpleasant tasks yourself
> - You are available if they need you
> - Ask if it's a good time if you need them
> - Ask questions to help them improve

> - Be humble and generous:
>     - they take the praise
>     - you take the criticism
> - Expect to do less programming
> - Keep ownership of one component

- Get off their critical path
- Guide them around roadblocks
- Cultivate a [growth mindset][DGM]
- If you are grateful, say so
- Praise in public, criticize in private 
- Double estimates (again)

In an [agile][AGL] environment remember the [basics][AID]:

> What to do:
> 
> - Find out where you are
> - Take a small step towards your goal
> - Adjust your understanding based on what you learned
> - Repeat
>
> How to do it:
>
> When faced with two or more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value, 
> take the path that makes future change easier.

When [writing][ABW]:

- Think about your audience 
- Edit and imagine £100 <del>for every single word you delete</del> per deletion
- Keep it [simple][CHQ]

    If you don't understand the word your audience might not either

    You [don't need complex sentences][GBW] to explain complex ideas
- If you think the tone is off, it is
- Keep emails under five sentences
- Edit it again

Other times, just remember: 

- Don't spend time with people you don't like
- When someone talks [listen][WAL], properly
- Take the [help][DTH]
- Fall seven times, stand up eight
- Action expresses [priorities][MGQ]
