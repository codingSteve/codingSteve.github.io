Investigating Haskell.
-------------------------

Haskell is lovely, it's beautiful but is it useful for a 
coder like me or you? I thought I'd try the Haskell functional programming course on EDX to find out.

The coolest thing I've written so far is the three lines of code
below. The EDX exercises often ask you to identify the correct 
implementations from a few variations of the same function.
Being a lazy developer I'm not prepared to manually exercise the 
functions, I'll let Haskell do that for me. 


    43 t  f (a,b,c) = (f a b) == c
    44 
    45 test f       = and (map (\(a,b,c) -> t  f (a,b,c)) bs)
    46 
    47 tests        = map (\(n,f) -> (n,test f)) fs

There are a few things to cover in the three dense lines above

##lambda functions
These are anonymous functions and are available in 
modern languages like perl and scala. In Haskell they look like
this:

    \ x -> x + 1

##Tuples


##Maps
