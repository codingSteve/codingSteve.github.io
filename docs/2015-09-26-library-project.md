Based on the simple spec, we have four pieces of functionality to support:

- [borrow a book][ITEM1]
- [return a book][ITEM2]
- [view the available items][ITEM3]
- [view the overdue items][ITEM4]


Borrowing a book
----------------

In order to borrow a book from the library, we have some preconditions:

- we are a member of the library
- we have permission to borrow the book
- the book must be available
